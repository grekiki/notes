# notes
Website, but mostly for learning purposes
Plan
* <s>Make a flask website</s>
* <s>Have it count visits per IP in cache folder</s>
* <s>Have a website run on Docker</s>
* Have a unittest that builds a website
* Have a github action that caches the cache folder, so the website can keep the traffic counts.
